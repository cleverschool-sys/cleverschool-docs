## Overview

*Section 11 (s11) of the Children Act 2004 places a duty on key bodies to ensure that their functions (and any that
they contract out to others) are discharged “with regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of
children”.*

Most local authorities work with schools to ensure this duty is complied with by conducting an annual safeguarding
audit/self-review. These vary in format between authorities and in some must be recorded using a local structure.
In others, a school based comprehensive review is accepted.

Common items you would record are preconfigured, and you can add others as required.
Our Safeguarding Review combines the s11 reviews from a number of LAs and covers their common cores as well as
additional local items. Since all are sensible checks on process most schools choose to use all of them.

### Features

* Additional items can be added if required and individual items can be disabled or removed if not required.

* Groups of requirements can be assigned to members of your senior staff and individual requirements can be assigned to
individual members of school staff.

* Save your review details and update them throughout the year.

* When any item is reviewed, it can also be updated with some information to explain how the school complies with the
regulation or how it plans to develop this further in the future.

* Area and item owners are reminded when reviews are due. This defaults to annually but a review date can be set for any
point up to 18 months ahead.

* Print out the audit as evidence of compliance for review by governors, Ofsted or for the LA.
