## Overview

*Self-evaluations aren't required by Ofsted but almost every school has one in order to reflect on its strengths as well
as areas for development. This is an ongoing document used by senior leaders and governors and can also be shared with
Ofsted at inspection. Keeping track of the many criteria and considering them both at the level of detailed evaluation
as well as in overview is a complex task and often leads to long complex documents.*

Our system provides the structure to consider a school's effectiveness in each area of the framework and set it in the
school's context and previous inspections.

A self-evaluation needs to consider the school's successes and challenges in its own context. Our system provides a
section for a number of contextual statements at the start of the document to set the scene for the evaluative sections
further on.

Self-evaluation is part of the school improvement process so a section is also provided where the priorities from the
last inspection and the response to them can be detailed. This section also enables you to record a high level summary
for the main school development plan which will be echoed in the separate Ofsted areas of the SEF.

### Features

* Track details against individual criteria and then zoom out to a high level summary of strengths and areas for
development.

* Each of the individual criteria required for a good inspection are detailed and the school's view of them recorded.
Optionally, more detail about the evidence to support the evaluation of those criteria can be included. Very detailed
evidence can be hyperlinked to the evaluation. Additionally, the descriptors for Outstanding evaluation can be evaluated
and evidence detailed.

* For each area of the framework you can record a summary along with four key areas of detail: actions recently taken in
that area, the impact of those actions, strengths in the area and priorities for further development. This provides a
single page summary for each area which is extremely helpful for governors, wider leadership and all staff generally.

* Additional sections enable you to provide contextual information and also document progress against your last report
alongside current development priorities.
