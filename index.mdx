These school systems are intended to make the operation of routine but important tasks in schools streamlined and more
efficient. We welcome feedback on their operation and especially suggestions for improvements or new functionality.

The system consists of a number of `Modules` that an `Administrator` can enable and that are then operated by `Managers`
and other staff.

`Modules` include:

- Risk Assessments
- Health and Safety Audit
- Safeguarding Audit
- Compliance Audit
- Development Plans
- School Calendars
- Professional Development / Appraisal
- Professional Standards
- Ofsted Self Evaluation
- Section 48 (SIAMS and Catholic) Self Evaluation
- Risk Register
- Site Room Audit
- School Documents
- Website content utilities e.g. Curriculum publication
- Applications
- Enrolments

<Tip>
    To get started it is first necessary to have a school set up! This can be done easily using the
    [Register](https://cleverschool.systems/register) form.
</Tip>

<Warning>
    Schools using the system in groups (e.g. in a MAT or LA) need to be set up centrally so that they are linked to
    others in their group.
