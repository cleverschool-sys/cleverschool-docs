## Overview

School calendars are cyclical and repeat every year. In most calendars, transferring events forward a year at a time is
time-consuming and prone to errors; our system simplifies and automates this.

It is also important that people know when events are taking place so we provide links to integrate dates into other
calendar apps and systems. Additionally, staff can subscribe to calendars and receive a weekly digest of upcoming
events.

### Features

* Create and publish calendars of events across the school year.

* Calendars can be broken into subsections so that different levels of detail can be shared with different groups of
staff or with Governors and Parents.

* Publish these to staff and parents easily using iCal links on websites or via emails and messaging so that parents,
staff and students can see the key dates relevant to them on their personal devices.

* Easily transfer events forward to future years.
