## Overview

### Create and publish calendars of events across the school year.

School calendars are cyclical and repeat every year. In most calendars, transferring events forward a year at a time is
time-consuming and prone to errors, but our system simplifies and automates this.

Calendars can be broken into subsections so that different levels of detail can be shared with different groups of staff
or with Governors and Parents.

### Publish these to staff and parents easily using iCal links

iCal links enable calendars to be published on websites or via emails and messaging so that parents, staff and students
can see the key dates relevant to them on their personal devices.

### Easily update these from year to year.

All events are recorded relative to the start of the academic year and therefore can be rolled forward automatically.
Dates in the new year can be adjusted for different holiday dates or if the event is re-scheduled.
