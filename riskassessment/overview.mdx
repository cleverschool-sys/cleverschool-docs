## Overview

Risk Assessment is an important activity in schools whether planning an adventurous trip, teaching students or managing
a playground. Often the risks, hazards and regular controls are clearly understood and seem like common sense but every
time a new member of staff joins there will be something new for them that everyone else takes for granted.

Recording risk assessments consistently and clearly provides a clear reference for all staff and enables a systematic
review of controls to take place when accidents and incidents occur.

Some risk assessments may need specific actions to be taken from time to time. These can be added and assigned to staff
who will be reminded when the actions are due.

All staff have a responsibility for Health and Safety and can contribute risk assessments for new activities as well as
contact the owners of existing risk assessments for clarification or to improve them. Once ready, designated staff can
approve the risk assessments for wider adoption.

<Tip>
    If a risk assessment is updated, or is older than a year, approvers are alerted to review and re-approve.
