## Overview

*A key part of Health and Safety compliance is the regular checking of rooms and areas in the school. A menu of 28
checks across 7 areas of health and safety is provided for each room and can be customised as required for individual
spaces.*

### Features

* Organise rooms by buildings or even sites.

* Record basic checks for each room as well as actions required.

* Most rooms should be checked annually but some, such as laboratories and workshops, need more frequent checks and this
can be individually configured.

* Failing checks require actions to be recorded and managers receive alerts about these as well as pending or overdue
checks.
