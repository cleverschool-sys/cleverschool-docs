## Overview

*Let your staff organise and publish your school curriculum in a structured way including key vocabulary, website links
and SMSC coverage. Subject leads can draft changes but need the approval of publishers before changes go live - keep
control of your content!*

The curriculum is organised by year and subjects and then units of work. You can have as many units as you need and
define the sequence of delivery. Each unit has a short title and description and a brief description of the way it will
be assessed.

### Features

* Units can be tagged with elements of SMSC that they provide and details of how they do this can be entered too.

* Key vocabulary with meanings and examples can be added for each unit and words can be re-used in other units.

* Alternative, more sophisticated definitions and examples can be provided for older year groups.

<Tip>
    Once published the curriculum is available via an API from unique URLs that your website can call to receive the
    content in JSON format. Displaying the content requires knowledge of JSON format data.
