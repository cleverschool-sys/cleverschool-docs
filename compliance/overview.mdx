## Overview

*Schools have a wide range of regulatory requirements to comply with (e.g. DfE Website requirements) and these are
scattered across a range of sources. This module enables them all to be collected together and monitored in one place.*

We provide a default set of requirements ranging from statutory policies and website requirements to core financial
regulations etc.

### Features
* Configure the checks we provide for your school and add additional ones if necessary

* Groups of schools can choose to manage some requirements centrally to reduce school-based workload and increase
consistency.

* Individual staff can be responsible for areas or individual checks and be reminded of when they are due.

* Groups of requirements can be assigned to members of your senior staff and individual requirements can be assigned
to individual members of school staff or governors.

* Save your review details and update them throughout the year.

* When any item is reviewed, it can also be updated with some information to explain how the school complies with the
regulation or how it plans to develop this further in the future.

* Area and item owners are reminded when reviews are due. This defaults to annually but a review date can be set for
any point up to 18 months ahead.

* Print out the audit as evidence of compliance for review by governors.
