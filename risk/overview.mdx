## Overview

We know that risk registers aren't necessarily the most exciting or often used documents in schools so having a simple
system to manage and present them is in our view essential! This module enables you to record risks clearly as well as
your approach to managing them and associated control measures.

### Features

* Likelihood and impact are used to record a risk level before and after treatment.

* Group risks together in categories and simply present them online to manage them.

* Print as a PDF for record keeping and governors.

* Classify your approach to each risk as Treat, Tolerate, Transfer ot Terminate. The most common approach is "Treat" so
this is the default.

* After assessing `likelihood` and `impact` before treatment you record the methods of control and assess the new level
of risk.

* Record additional notes to assist governors and others interpreting the register.

<Tip>
    Often it is helpful to write notes when a risk level has changed or is newly identified. Separating this information
    from the controls or description helps keep the register succinct and readable.
