## Overview

*These are some tools that are used to enhance content on school websites*

### Staff Contact Forms

* Enable contact with named staff or departments from a web form.

* Protect against Internet bots "spamming" your staff inbox.

* Incoming email is copied to an office address so that it can be responded to centrally if you preferred.

* Staff replies are sent via the office to ensure quality and consistency.

### Word of the week

* Provide data for webpages to display a different word each week along with its meaning, an example and translation
into one or two languages.

* Set up words for the whole year in advance.

* Previous words can be viewed on another webpage if required.
