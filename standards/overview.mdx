## Overview

*Professional standards frameworks exist in many countries and typically new teachers are required to demonstrate evidence of their competency against these frameworks.*

Some frameworks, for example in Australia, there are descriptions of increasing levels of proficiency which teachers can use to reflect on their own practice and schools can use to plan professional development programmes.

Some groups of schools, for example some Multi Academy Trusts in the UK, have their own descriptions of professional growth which they use in a similar way.

This module enables teachers to reflect on their professional practice using these frameworks and, if appropriate, store evidence to support that reflection.

### Features

* Content of major professional standards frameworks can be pre-loaded for your school's use.

* Individual staff can access their own self reflection at any time and store evidence if they wish.

* The record can be shared with a colleague or coach to support developmental activities.
