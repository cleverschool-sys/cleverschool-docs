## Overview

Accept and manage applications to your Sixth Form.

### Features

* Gather the key information from external applicants who are interested in joining your school's sixth form.

* Use the system before and after open events as part of both your marketing strategy and enrolment and curriculum
planning process.

* Easy registration either on the site or using social media enables applicants to tell you about themselves and what
they would like to study. Use this system for both internal and external students. Internals don't need to provide
application data but can easily record their preferences for courses to help with your planning and enrolment process.
