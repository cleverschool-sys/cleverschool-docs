## Overview

*Schools have a wide range of Health and Safety requirements to comply with and these are scattered across a range of
sources. This module enables them all to be collected together and monitored in one place.*

We have gathered together 280 requirements and good practice across 35 categories from accidents to e-safety, managing
contractors to operating swimming pool and many more.You can configure the checks we provide for your school and add
additional ones if necessary

## Features

* Groups of requirements can be assigned to members of your Senior Leadership but individual requirements can be
assigned to individual members of school staff or governors.

* When any item is reviewed, it can also be updated with some information to explain how the school complies with the
regulation or how it plans to develop this further in the future.

* Area and item owners are reminded when reviews are due. This defaults to annually but a review date can be set for any
point up to 18 months ahead.

* Print out the audit as evidence of compliance for review by governors.
