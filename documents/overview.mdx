## Overview

All schools maintain libraries of key documents that staff need access to. This system provides an easy to access
repository where staff can be asked to indicate that they have read and understood particular documents.

### Features

* Configure groups of document types e.g. policies, guidance, handbooks.

* Allocate staff to documents to require confirmation that they have read them.

* Managers can monitor confirmations and remind people where necessary.
